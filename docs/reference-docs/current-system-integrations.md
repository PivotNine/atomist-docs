## Current Integrated Systems

Atomist aims to give you the best experiences across industry leading software development collaboration tools. As such we are always increasing the list of integration we have with those tools, and at the moment Atomist currently supports the following:

* [GitHub](http://www.github.com)
* [Slack](https://slack.com/)

***Check back here often as we are always working on growing this list.***

### Current Integration Constraints

Currently Atomist supports only one GitHub "owner" per Slack team. In this case the *Owner* could be an organisation or a user's personal account. It is one the Atomist roadmap to eventually allow multiple GitHub user accounts per Slack team.

***Once again, check back here often as we are always working to reduce these constraints where they impede our users.***
