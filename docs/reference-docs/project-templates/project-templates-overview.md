## Overview of Atomist Project Templates

Atomist Project Templates are projects used by Atomist to create new projects. If you find yourself creating a type of microservice frequently, distilling that into an Atomist Project Template that you, your team and even the wider community can use will really speed up your software development.

> ***NOTE:*** Atomist Project Templates are even more helpful when it comes to working with microservices... Creating new microservices frequently is often a core skill in working with this architectural style and Atomist Project Templates get you focussed on the unique code that you really need to write in those new services without being distracted by re-coding the wheel every time.
