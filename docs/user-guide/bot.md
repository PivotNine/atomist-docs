At Atomist we believe the goal of automation is that no interface is
required: everything is automated.  But, for the time before you reach
the point of complete automation, Atomist provides the Atomist Bot.

You can get an up-to-date list of commands the Atomist Bot understands
by sending it a "help" message in any Slack channel to which it has
been invited.

```
@atomist help
```

You can learn how to interact with the Atomist Bot by watching some of
the videos on the [Atomist YouTube Channel][youtube].
