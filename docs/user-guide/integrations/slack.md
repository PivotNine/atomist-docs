[Slack][slack], through its real-time messaging (RTM) API, is the
supported means for interacting with the Atomist Bot.  Slack messages
are sent to Atomist where they are processed and the proper action
taken.

Atomist must be [installed][install] in your Slack team and the
Atomist Bot must be invited to channels where you would like to
interact with it.  The [Getting Started][getting-started] guide takes
you through this process step by step.
