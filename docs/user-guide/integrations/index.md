Atomist aims to give you the best experiences across industry leading
software development collaboration tools.  These include chat
platforms, source code repositories, continuous integration servers,
and runtime platforms.  Currently, the Atomist platform integrates
with the following third-party systems:

-   [Slack](slack.md)
-   [GitHub.com](github.md)
-   [Travis CI](travis-ci.md)
-   [Jenkins](jenkins.md)

We are always working to improve the developer experience, including
increasing the number integrations we support as demand dictates.
***Check back here often as we are always working on growing this
list.***

Additionally, Atomist users can create custom integrations for the
tools they use that are not natively supported by Atomist.
