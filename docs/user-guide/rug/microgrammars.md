Microgrammars are *"partial grammars designed to extract
checker-specific features only"*.

When there is no out of the box support for a file type, and plain file
manipulation is too clumsy and random,
Atomist [microgrammar (pdf)][microgrammar] support allows you to safely pinpoint elements of files and edit them with clean diffs.
