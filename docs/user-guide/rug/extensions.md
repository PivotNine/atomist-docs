Rug extensions represent different types of source code, events, and
systems which Rug can understand and interact with.  Each Rug
extension defines a set of operations you can use to get and
modify the system or language it represents.

A fundamental Rug extension is `Project`.  `Project` represents a
source code repository and allows you get information about the
repository, e.g., if a file exists, and to alter the repository, e.g.,
add or delete a file.

Atomist makes several Rug extensions available to all its users.  Many
of the standard extensions provide understanding and operations to
alter common software development languages like Java, C#, Python,
Clojure, and Scala.  Other extensions provide connectivity to common
software development tools like CI platforms.
