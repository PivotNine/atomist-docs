A key design goal for Rug was to respect your own tooling as much as
possible so that *every project could be a working Atomist project,
and every Atomist project remains a working project*.  Therefore,
Atomist files reside unobtrusively within your existing projects.
Specifically, Atomist files reside in a directory named `.atomist` at
the root of your project's source code hierarchy.

## The `.atomist` directory

A typical Rug project will have a `.atomist` directory that looks
something like the following.

```console
.atomist
├── build/
├── editors/
├── generators/
├── handlers/
├── manifest.yml
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── reviewers/
├── target/
├── templates/
├── tests/
└── tsconfig.json
```

The table below explains each entry.

Entry | Description
------|------------
`build` | contains CI build scripts and configuration
`editors` | contains Rug editors
`generators` | contains Rug generators
`handlers` | contains Rug command and event handlers
`manifest.yml` | Rug archive metadata and dependencies declarations
`node_modules` | contains source code for TypeScript typings and dependencies installed by [NPM][npm]
`package.json` | standard NPM `package.json` file declaring the TypeScript dependencies
`reviewers` | contains Rug reviewers
`target` | contains files generated by the Rug CLI during building and packaging
`templates` | contains templates used by Rugs
`tests` | contains Rug tests
`tsconfig.json` | TypeScript compiler options useful for IDE TypeScript tooling

!!! note ""
    The `tsconfig.json` is *not* used by the Rug CLI when compiling TypeScript.

## Basic Rug Project

A very basic Rug project can be generated using
the [Rug project generator][rug-generator].  Instructions running the
generator using the Rug CLI can be found in the project's README.
