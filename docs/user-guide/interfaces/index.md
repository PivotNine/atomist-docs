At Atomist we believe the goal of automation is that no interface is
required: everything is automated.  But, for the time before you reach
the point of complete automation, Atomist provides two main user
interfaces.

-   [**Atomist Bot**][bot]: interacting with Atomist in chat
-   [**Rug CLI**][cli]: interacting with Atomist on the command line

[bot]: bot.md
[cli]: cli/index.md
