## Why and What is Rug?

Rug is a medium for code that modifies code. Rug helps developers automate development.
When a coding task is common, tedious, nitpicky, or hard to remember how to do correctly,
 there's value in encoding how it's done, instead of performing the typing every time.

The Rug ecosystem includes a language, runtime, test runner, and package manager.
The Rug language is optional; there's also a [TypeScript module](https://medium.com/the-composition/atomist-meet-typescript-2f2e16251d4f#.nmxmjfg6q),
so you can combine a general-purpose language with the tooling of Rug.
The Rug runtime runs as a service, accessible from any Slack that has invited the Atomist Bot (try it in [Atomist Community slack](https://join.atomist.com)).
There's also the [Rug CLI](rug-cli/index.md) for local use, essential for Rug development.
