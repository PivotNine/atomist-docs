## Enrolling your organisation with Atomist

Your journey with Atomist begins with enrolling Atomist in your Slack and Github organisations.

> ***NOTE:*** At the moment Github and Slack are the two main systems that Atomist can work with. More are in the works and bookmark the [reference documenation]() to be notified as we add them.

## Enrolling Atomist into Slack

First make sure you have a Slack team and a GitHub organisation that you want to use. Then once you have your organisations set up on those systems, execute the following steps to enroll Atomist:

* Start the process using [this link](https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=channels:read,channels:write,channels:history,im:read,im:write,chat:write:user,team:read,bot&client_id=9196525393.17722124420).
* When promoted, authorise Atomist for your Slack team

## Adding Permissions for GitHub

When you log into your slack team you should now get a message from Atomist asking you to authorise for your GitHub organisations.

* Click on the link to authorise Atomist for your GitHub organisations
* You should then receive a message on your Slack organisation's `General` channel asking you to identify which github organisation to use for this team. Select your GitHub organisation of choice for Atomist to be able to create and add to repositories in that organisation.

Congratulations, you're now all set to use Atomist!
