## Deleting and Tidying Up a Microservice

The simplest way to delete a microservice is by using the bot from the slack channel that Atomist created when it created the microservice and it's repository in the first place...

However at the moment Atomist is not by default given permissions to delete repositories from your GitHub organisation and so if you as the bot to `@atomist delete` you'll get a negative response that the bot is not allowed.

Coming soon there will be a set of instructions on how to enable these permissions in your very own Atomist bot.
