## Create Atomist Project Templates

Creating new projects, especially if you're working with multiple microservices, and coordinating them across group discussion channels is a real challenge!

Microservices means lots of projects, continually changing as you come up with the right microservices for your own domain and context. Creating those projects really shouldn't be a hit on productivity and so Atomist has considered this a core feature from its very start.

Of course, Atomist comes with its own set of great project starter templates out-of-the-box. Just grab the bot and ask "list templates" and you'll see. But really the best templates for your world will come from you!

This is where custom templates come in.

You can start to create a project template of your own in three main ways:

* [Forking and customising an existing Atomist Project Template](new-project-template-from-fork.md)
* [Creating an Atomist Project Template from Scratch](new-project-template-from-scratch.md)
* ***Coming soon*** *Super Forking* an existing project of your own into being the basis for a new Atomist Project Template
