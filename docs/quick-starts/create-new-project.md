We recognised that creating new projects is an incredibly common task in microservice-based systems. As such Atomist uses templates to make creating new projects as quick as possible.

## Creating a new project based on an Atomist Project Template

First ask Atomist to creatte a new microservice for you:

```shell
> @atomist create microservice
```

And you should be promoted for what Atomist Project Template to use as a starting point:

```shell
> `<your username>`, I can help you create a new service. 
`<your username>`, which ​*template*​ shall I use? (`blank-name`, `local-kafka-infra`, `treehorn-spring-rest-microservice`, `treehorn-springboot-monitored-microservice`, `spring-rest-service`)
```
