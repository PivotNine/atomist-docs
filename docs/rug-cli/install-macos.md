## Install the Rug CLI on Mac OS X / macOS

The easiest way to get start on a Mac is to install the Rug CLI using
our [Homebrew][brew] [tap][] repository.

[brew]: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew
[tap]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme

Once you have Homebrew installed, it is just two easy steps:

```sh
$ brew tap atomist/tap
$ brew install rug-cli
```
