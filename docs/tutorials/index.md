In the [Getting Started][gs] section, you connected Atomist to your
development systems and learned how to use some of the out-of-the-box
functionality that Atomist provides.  These tutorials will teach you
how to extend and customize Atomist, tailoring it to your own
development workflow and processes.  Some of the materials in the
later tutorials build on what has been done and learned in the earlier
tutorials, so it is best to work through them in order if you can.
