## Current Integrated Systems

Atomist aims to give you the best experiences across industry leading
software development collaboration tools.  While much of the
interactivity of Atomist with various development platforms and
systems is done via Rugs, some external systems are core enough to the
Atomist experience that they require tighter integrations.  These
include chat platforms and source code repositories.  Currently, the
Atomist platform integrates with the following third-party platforms:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Slack](https://slack.com/)

We are always working to improve the developer experience, including
increasing the number integrations we support as demand dictates.

list.***
