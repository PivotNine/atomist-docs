Atomist can listen for continuous integration (CI) events, correlate
them with the commits that triggered the build, and show
contextualized notifications in an appropriate Slack channel.
To enable this, you need to connect Atomist to your CI system.
Atomist currently integrates with the following CI systems:

-   [Travis CI][travis]
-   [Jenkins][jenkins]
