## Slack

Chat is one of the main interfaces for Atomist.  Currently we support
the [Slack][slack] chat platform.  You can use any Slack team you are
currently a member of with Atomist.  If you do not currently use Slack, don't have [permissions to add an app][slack-app] to your existing Slack team, or prefer to use a new Slack team with Atomist, you can <a

## GitHub

Atomist wants to get to know your code.  Currently Atomist integrates
with [GitHub.com][github] and GitHub Enterprise.  

If you already have a GitHub.com account,
you can use it with Atomist. You will need to be a member of one or more GitHub organizations where you have permission to [authorize OAuth Apps][github-oauth]. If you do not have a GitHub.com
account, you can [create a GitHub account][github-join] for free. If you are not a member of a GitHub organization, you can [create a public org for free][github-org].

If you use GitHub Enterprise, please [get in touch directly][contact] with us.
