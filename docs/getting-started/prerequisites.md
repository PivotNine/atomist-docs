## Atomist Alpha

If you have not yet requested access to the Atomist Alpha,
please fill out the [request form][alpha].  Using the information
provided in the form, we will reach out to you with further
instructions for completing your enrollment.  If you have filled out
the form and have yet to receive the email with further instructions,
please reach out to us in the <a href="https://join.atomist.com/" alt="join atomist community" target="_blank">Atomist Community Slack</a>
`#support` channel.

## Slack

Chat is one of the main interfaces for Atomist.  Currently we support
the [Slack][slack] chat platform.  You can use any Slack team you are
currently a member of with Atomist.  If you do not currently use Slack
or prefer to use a new Slack team with Atomist, you
can <a href="https://slack.com/create" alt="create slack team" target="_blank">create a new Slack team</a> for free.

## GitHub

Atomist wants to get to know your code.  Currently Atomist integrates
with [Github.com][github].  If you already have a GitHub.com account,
you can use Atomist with that.  If you do not have a GitHub.com
account, you can <a href="https://github.com/join" alt="create github account" target="_blank">create an account</a> for free.
