-   An invitation to the [Atomist Alpha Program][alpha]
-   A [Slack][slack] team
-   A [GitHub.com][github] user

If you already have your Atomist Alpha Program invitation, Slack team,
and GitHub.com account, you can proceed to the next step by clicking

## Atomist Alpha Program

To get invited to the Atomist Alpha Program, please fill out
the [request form][alpha].  Using the information provided in the
form, we will reach out to you with further instructions for
completing your enrollment.

## Slack

Chat is one of the main interfaces for Atomist.  Currently we support
the [Slack][slack] chat platform.  You can use any Slack team you are
currently a member of with Atomist.  If you do not currently use Slack
or prefer to use a new Slack team with Atomist, you
can [create a new Slack team][create-slack] for free.

## GitHub

Atomist wants to get to know your code.  Currently Atomist integrates
with [Github.com][github].  If you already have a GitHub.com account,
you can use Atomist with that.  If you do not have a GitHub.com
account, you can [create an account][create-github] for free.
