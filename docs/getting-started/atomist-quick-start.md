# Quick Start

So you want to get started streamlining your development with Atomist. You're in the right place. This guide is a companion to guide you through enrolling and getting started. In this Quick Start, you will:

- Set up the @atomist bot in your Slack team to get notifications and be able to take actions across GitHub and CI
- Authorize Atomist on your GitHub Organization or user account so that we can show notifications in Slack and automate actions in GitHub for you
- Optionally, configure Atomist to listen for your CI events (currently Travis CI or Jenkins)
- Set up automated event handling for common development flow activities
- Create your first custom automation

## Before you get started

You'll want these in place before we get going:

* A Slack team where you can authorize the @atomist bot
* A GitHub org or user account to authorize the Atomist OAuth app

Okay, let's get started!

## Set up Atomist in Slack

Authorize the [Atomist Slack App](). You'll be asked to sign into your team if you're not already signed in.
