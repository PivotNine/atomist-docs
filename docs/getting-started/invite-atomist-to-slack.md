With everything in place to get started with Atomist, you can now
invite the Atomist bot to your Slack team.  After you filled out
the [Atomist Alpha Program][alpha] form, you should have received an
email invitation that looks something like the following:

[alpha]: https://atomist.typeform.com/to/MseQBs (Atomist Alpha Program)

To invite the Atomist bot into your Slack team, simply click the
"Install Atomist Bot in Slack" button in the Atomist Alpha Program
invitation email.

Clicking the button will send you to a web page where you will be
asked to sign into your Slack team if you are not already signed in.
Provide your Slack team domain and click Continue.

the Slack sign-in.  If you have trouble signing in, check
out [Slack help][slack-help].

After successfully signing in, you will see the authorization page for
the Atomist app, including the Slack permissions requested.  Confirm
that the correct Slack team is selected and click "Authorize".

Once you have successfully authorized the Atomist bot in your Slack
team, you will be redirected to a confirmation page.  You can close
this page and go back to Slack to continue this guide.

By default, the Atomist bot will be named `@atomist` and will join the
`#general` channel in your Slack team.  You can invite the Atomist bot
into any other channel in the same way you would invite any other
user: an `@` mention and invite, the `/invite @atomist` command, or
via the channel settings > "Invite team members to join ...".
