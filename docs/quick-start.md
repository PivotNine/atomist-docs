# Develop your first Software Delivery Machine

The easiest way to get started with Atomist is to start on your laptop, working with local commits. Then register your SDM with our service, integrating with Slack, your source control management, and your existing continuous integration tools.

The latest getting-started tutorials are over at [developer-tutorials][tutorials] for now. Issues and contributions welcome.

Warning: while these should be smooth on MacOS or Linux, we're still working through some issues on Windows. Please let us know if something doesn't work for you.

When you're ready to put your SDM to work for your whole team, continue with [setup][setup].
