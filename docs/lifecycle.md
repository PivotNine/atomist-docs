Chat notifications about pushes, builds, pull requests, issues, and issue comments are
fewer and far more useful when they're correlated by Atomist. You get one message per push, and 
that message updates as new information comes in. Less spam in your channels! Even better, 
the messages have buttons that make them useful.

## Messages
