The Atomist command line is useful for starting SDMs and configuring your connection.

In [local mode][local], the `atomist` command line runs commands in your SDM.

## help

Run `atomist --help` to see a list of options. Since `atomist` can run multi-word commands,
only the first word of each is listed in the help. Drill down by asking for more specific help.

For instance, `atomist --help` yields (among other lines):

        atomist show                    ... 2 commands

To find out what you can show, use `atomist show --help`.

        Commands:
          atomist show sdms    Show connected sdms
          atomist show skills  Show skills
