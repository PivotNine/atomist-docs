Atomist is all about helping you ship high-quality software in less
time.  Whether you are working with large legacy codebases, your own
"majestic monoliths", or aiming for "zero-overhead microservices",
Atomist provides you with the tools to speed development, smooth
operations, and close the code/runtime feedback loop.

Atomist helps you develop better software more quickly in several
important ways:

-   Linking related events from source code repositories, continuous
    integration, testing, and runtime environments, presenting them in
    a unified manner to appropriate team members to greatly reduce
    context-switching costs and incident time-to-resolution.
-   Managing a service life cycle, from commits to CI builds to
    deployments to alerts to corrective action
-   Automating common tasks in software development and operation,
    for example:
    -   Using Rug editors to modify code in a consistent mannger
        across many repositories
    -   Ensuring a project conforms with your standards using a Rug
        reviewer
