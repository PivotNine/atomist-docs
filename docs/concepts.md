Atomist is a new approach to software development that pushes the
limits of automation and blurs the boundaries between projects, code,
tooling, and operations.  Pushing boundaries means extending some
well-known concepts and introducing some new ideas.  In this section,
we present overarching concepts integral to Atomist and how it
improves the software you create.

At its core, Atomist is partner that improves your development process
through automation.  The automation we are talking about goes well
beyond what traditionally comes to mind when talking about IT
automation.  Atomist is not a configuration management system.
Atomist is not a templating system.  Atomist is not
infrastructure-as-code.  Atomist is not a DevOps platform.  Atomist is
not a ChatOps platform.  Atomist brings all of those things
together&hellip; and more.

## Software as a Service

## Eventing system

## Rug is the runtime

### Events flow in and out

### Operations respond to events

#### Alerting developers

#### Releasing software

#### Modifying code

#### Testing integrations

## Integrations (get events, call APIs/commands)

## Interfaces

### Bot

### CLI

Running, building, and testing Rugs

### None

the real power is when no interface is needed, i.e., full automation of responses to events
